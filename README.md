# XMUM-Parcel-System

This is a concept project aims to solve XMUM's offline parcel management system.

As number of students in Xiamen began to grow, the queueing line at the parcel collection office began to grow as well. This is cause by poor management of parcel documentationa and organisation.

To solve this issue, my friends and I had came up with a concept for our campus parcel's system, in hope it will improve the line and workflow of our current campus's parcel system.

Below are screenshots of what the concept web system looks like:
